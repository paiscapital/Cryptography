### Logic Algorithm
```
key = iloveyou
message = its good for you, good for you

keyGenerator = iloveyouiloveyouiloveyouiloveyou

^ stand for XOR

ENCRYPT
i ^ i
t ^ l
s ^ o
...

DECRYPT
cipher = \x00\x18\x1cV\x02\x16\x00\x11I\n\x00\x04E\x00\x00\x00EL\x08\x19\n\x1dO\x13\x06\x1eO\x0f\n\x0c
keyGenerator = iloveyouiloveyouiloveyouiloveyou

\x00 ^ i
\x18 ^ l
\x1c ^ o
...
```
