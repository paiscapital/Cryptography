# Ceaser Cipher

### What is?
> Substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 23, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on

### Logic Algorithm
```
Encryption
A shift for 23 times = X (+)

Decryption
X unshift for 23 times = A (-)

 TABLE (23 shift)
ENC     |       DEC
A       |       X
B       |       Y
C       |       Z
D       |       A
E       |       B
F       |       C
G       |       D
