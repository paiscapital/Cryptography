A       |       Z
B       |       Y
C       |       X
D       |       W
E       |       V
F       |       U
G       |       T
H       |       S
I       |       R
J       |       Q
K       |       P
L       |       O
M       |       N
N       |       M
O       |       L
P       |       K
Q       |       J
R       |       I
S       |       H
T       |       G
U       |       F
V       |       E
W       |       D
X       |       C
Y       |       B
Z       |       A
