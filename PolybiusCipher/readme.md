# Polybius Cipher

### What is?
> A device invented by the ancient Greeks Cleoxenus and Democleitus, and made famous by the historian and scholar Polybius. The device was originally used for fire signalling, allowing for the coded transmission of any message, not just a finite number of predetermined options as was the convention before.

### Logic Algorithm
```
- TABLE
  1  2  3  4  5
1 A  B  C  D  E
2 F  G  H I/J K
3 L  M  N  O  P
4 Q  R  S  T  U
5 V  W  X  Y  Z

plaintext = WHAT IS YOU FAVORITE SQUARE

W = 25 # col 2 row 5
H = 32 # col 3 row 2
A = 11 # col 1 row 1
T = 44 # col 4 row 4

ciphertext = 25 32 11 44
